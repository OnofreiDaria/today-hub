                        MCSE boot camps have its supporters and its detractors.
                        Some people do not understand why you should have to spend money on boot camp when you can get the MCSE study materials yourself
                        at a fraction of the camp price. However, who has the willpower to actually sit through a self-imposed MCSE training?
                        Not too many people! That is what the MCSE boot camps are for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These boot camps are typically an intense two-week long MCSE training course that prepares you for the MCSE exams.
                        Some companies that conduct boot camps offering Microsoft certification, especially the MCSE, guarantee that you will pass your MCSE exams.
                        If you happen to fail, they will usually issue a voucher to try it again.
                        For many people who attend these MCSE boot camps, it is preferable to have an intense two weeks with little to distract you rather than
                        drawing out the classes for weeks with outside influences like work and family interfering with study time.
                        Sure, being gone for two weeks is a temporary hassle, but you will have your certification in a fraction of the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Did you catch the being gone for two weeks bit?
                        You can probably find a boot camp near your home, but most likely you will end up attending an MCSE boot camp away from your home,
                        far enough away where it is not worth it to commute. Two weeks away from home? That doesn’t sound like a picnic!
                        But just think of the rewards you will reap after trudging through all that MCSE training and taking the MCSE exams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are lucky, your company will pick up the tab on your Microsoft certification.
                        Paying on your own is a major investment, usually a few thousand dollars depending on where the location is and if
                        hotel and meals are included in the price. For your money, you will get a tough instructor,
                        an MCSE drill sergeant for lack of a better description. That instructor’s reputation is on the line,
                        so he or she will be motivated to ensure your success. That is why the success rate for these MCSE boot camps is high,
                        in some places as high as 95%!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For your investment, you will have numerous MCSE training sessions in Networking Basics as well as
                        learning about the infrastructure of a network. You will study security design, directories and how to manage
                        Windows network environments. Hands-on training in learning labs with after-hours access for extra practice is the norm.
                        Practice MCSE exams are also given out as a study tool and to also help prepare you for your own test time.
